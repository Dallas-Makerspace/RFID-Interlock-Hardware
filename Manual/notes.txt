There may be power save issues that cause the wifi to dissappear (device and all)

See https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/138688/wifi-disconnects-after-6-hours-on-raspian-11-pi-zero-2w

and   https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/96606/make-iw-wlan0-set-power-save-off-permanent

So far I haven't been able to successfully disable it. Except that I have.  It's not clear if 

sudo systemctl disable wifi_powersave@on.service
sudo systemctl enable wifi_powersave@off.service

did this after

One way to accomplish this is to build a systemd unit file which can execute the necessary command at boot. I will give you here a bit more comfortable example for switching off or on power_save. Create a Unit file with:

rpi ~$ sudo systemctl --full --force edit wifi_powersave@.service

In the empty editor insert these statements, save them and quit the editor:

[Unit]
Description=Set WiFi power save %i
After=sys-subsystem-net-devices-wlan0.device

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStart=/sbin/iw dev wlan0 set power_save %i

[Install]
WantedBy=sys-subsystem-net-devices-wlan0.device


editing /etc/rc.local did not seem to work on boot up
