# RFID-Interlock-Hardware
Documentation and CAD source files for DMS RFID Interlock hardware

This is somewhat fragmentary documentation on the legacy RFID interlock box hardware (not those used in the woodshop) and a new version mechanically based on industry standard DIN rail components. 

Legacy hardware docs are divided into Legacy A - the prototype demo design used on the autolift and Shark lathe, and Legacy B - a group of unit constructed with parts on hand and slight mechanical variation.

Available CAD drawings only support complex parts.   I'll try and fill in some assembly drawings, possibly scans of hand drawings.
